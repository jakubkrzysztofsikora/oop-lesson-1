# oop-lesson-1
Repository of live example OOP in C#

Assignments:
* As a user of Mad Scientist Lab I want to have  atiger, a coyote and a hamster in the lab
* As a user of Mad Scientist Lab I want squeaker to support cats too
* As a user of Mad Scientist Lab I want to delete an animal from a lab

Basically: add three additonal animals, make Cat class to be accepted by Squeaker (cat squeak too!) and then implement the methods and CLI command to delete the animal by name.

Additional:
There's some code duplication and messy stuff, if you want to feel free to refactor.
